# 100MHz-Differential-Probe
100 MHz Differential Probe V2

The description of this project can be found on my blog :

and also on Bud Bennets blog:

Bud is the father of the differential probe design.

There are two versions of the same probe, one specifically tuned for the use of 240V. This is the version documented here. It also has a different power supply so standard 5V USB wall warts can be used.
The one Bud designed has a different power supply and is designed for 115V main supplies.
